# Dinomizer

Dinomizer is a web application designed to assist Creative Agencies with teams dispersed globally or working remotely. This application streamlines asset retrieval for projects by centralizing all assets in one location. This ensures that all project stakeholders can access the latest version of required assets, thus minimizing time loss.

Dinomizer is built using Django Rest Framework for the backend and React JS for the frontend. This project was created as my fifth portfolio project for my Diploma in Web Application Development at Code Institute.

Here is the live version of the application: [Dinomizer](https://dinomizer-6ec16116a4cb.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Goals

- Full featured assets sharing service
- Create and partecipate to a project
- Upload assets like images, videos, audio and text
- Contribute to a project
- Get approvals by the project manager (project owner) on the assets uploaded

## The Idea
My professional background lies in the video production and communication field. I owned my communication agency and worked with many of them as a freelancer. Sharing files and assets is crucial in such environments but sometimes the people involved in the same project are not updated on the last version of that logo or last version of the copywriting for a specific website.

To perform my job as video producer/maker at the best I often use a platform called [CI](https://cimediacloud.com/) (no pun intend... Code Institute!!!) from sony and it's from there that I took the inspiration. Though I'm pretty far from achieving Sony's results, I think Dinomizer come out as a nice CI wannabe.

## Future improvements
- create an Organization that contains projects
- set a local storage to store original files (large size)
- create authomatic lowres file to display inside the app
- evaluate team capacity
- diagram that displays how busy a user is so as a project manager I can decide to whom assign a task
- side navbar for a more appealing user experience
